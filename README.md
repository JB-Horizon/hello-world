# hello-world

Hello everyone, 
I'm Jon and im trying to teach myself how to code during this pandemic. I'm a single father of 2 young boys that I have full time and I am hoping I can make a career out of this to support my family. 
Any help and guidance along the way would be greatly appreciated and I hope eventually to be a valued member of the community once I develop my skills. 
Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did. All the best!
